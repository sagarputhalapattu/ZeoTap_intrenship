## **Project Overview: eCommerce Customer Segmentation & Clustering**

### **Objective**:
The goal of this project is to analyze an eCommerce transactions dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build models for customer segmentation and lookalike recommendations. The project involves:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Perform detailed analysis on customer, product, and transaction data to uncover trends, patterns, and business insights.
   - Derive actionable insights from data to improve business strategy, such as customer targeting and product offerings.

2. **Lookalike Model**:  
   - Build a recommendation system that finds similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
   - The model helps in identifying customers with behaviors similar to a given user, which is beneficial for personalized marketing.

3. **Customer Segmentation Using Clustering**:  
   - Segment customers into distinct groups using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means).
   - Grouping customers based on spending behavior, purchase frequency, and transaction history can inform business strategies like targeted promotions and loyalty programs.

### **Dataset Overview**:
The project uses three primary datasets:
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details including region, signup date, and demographics.
- **Products.csv**: Details about products sold, including price and category.
- **Transactions.csv**: Transaction history including product IDs, total value, quantity, and customer IDs.

### **Approach**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing or scaling features where necessary.
   - Merge customer, product, and transaction datasets for a comprehensive view of customer behavior.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform visual and statistical analysis to understand key patterns, such as purchase frequency, transaction volume, and customer demographics.
   - Generate business insights like the most profitable product categories, regions with high sales, and customer behavior trends.

3. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Use customer features and transaction data to build a model that calculates similarity scores between customers.
   - Recommend the top 3 similar customers to each of the first 20 customers in the dataset.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their transaction data and profile information.
   - Evaluate clustering results using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) and visualize clusters using 2D and 3D scatter plots.

### **Deliverables**:
- **Jupyter Notebooks** containing the code for:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Lookalike Model Implementation
  - Customer Segmentation via Clustering
- **PDF Reports**:
  - Business insights from EDA
  - Clustering evaluation and interpretation
  - Lookalike Model recommendations
- **Lookalike.csv**: A CSV file mapping customer IDs to their 3 most similar customers along with similarity scores.
- **Visualizations**: Plots and charts for key findings, including customer segmentation results.

### **Tools and Libraries Used**:
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (clustering, K-Means, etc.).
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the workflow and analysis.
- **FPDF**: For generating PDF reports.

### **Key Insights**:
- **Customer Segmentation**: The analysis revealed distinct groups of customers based on spending patterns and purchase frequency, which can guide personalized marketing efforts.
- **Lookalike Model**: The model efficiently recommends similar customers, aiding in targeted strategies for cross-selling and customer engagement.
- **Business Insights**: EDA uncovered trends such as high-spending customer clusters, profitable product categories, and regions with the highest growth potential.

### **Future Enhancements**:
- Implement more advanced clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
- Integrate additional customer features (e.g., browsing behavior, cart abandonment) to improve segmentation.
- Build a web interface to allow users to query similar customers and explore segmentation results interactively.
